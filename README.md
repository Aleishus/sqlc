A composable type safe fluent API to generate nested and complex SQL queries

Taking heavy inspiration from [JOOQ][], `sqlc` generates SQL queries for you:
	
	var FOO sqlc.TableLike // auto-generated by sqlc by introspecting your DB schema
	
	var db *db.DB // For integration with database/sql
	var d Dialect // Either sqlite, mysql or postgres

	row, err := Select(FOO.BAR).From(FOO).Where(FOO.BAZ.Eq("quux")).QueryRow(d, db)

If you don't want to use `database/sql`, you don't have to. `String(Dialect)` is an API call to just produce the SQL string that you use in any way that you want to:

	// Renders `SELECT foo.bar FROM foo WHERE foo.baz = ?`
	sql := Select(FOO.BAR).From(FOO).Where(FOO.BAZ.Eq("quux")).String(d)

Composing Queries
-----------------

You can compose query objects into reusebale and individually executable building blocks. For example, you can create a sub query that is in itself executable:

	subQuery := Select(
		CALL_RECORDS.REGION,
		CALL_RECORDS.DURATION.Min(),
		CALL_RECORDS.DURATION.Max(),
		CALL_RECORDS.DURATION.Avg()).
		From(CALL_RECORDS).
		GroupBy(CALL_RECORDS.REGION).
		OrderBy(CALL_RECORDS.REGION)

	row, err := subQuery.QueryRow(d, db)

And then you re-use the subquery as part of a new query:

	row, err := SelectCount().From(subQuery).QueryRow(d, db)

Type Safety
-----------

`sqlc` provides type safe methods for INSERTs and UPDATEs:

	result, err := InsertInto(CALL_RECORDS).
		SetString(CALL_RECORDS.IMSI, "230023741299234").
		SetTime(CALL_RECORDS.TIMESTAMP, time.Now()).
		SetInt(CALL_RECORDS.DURATION, 10).
		SetString(CALL_RECORDS.REGION, "quux").
		SetString(CALL_RECORDS.CALLING_NUMBER, "76581231298").
		SetString(CALL_RECORDS.CALLED_NUMBER, "76754238764").
		Exec(d, db)

For example, the following invocation would not compile:

		...
		SetTime(CALL_RECORDS.TIMESTAMP, "some string"). // Results in compile time error
		...

If you use the `sqlc` code generator, you can keep your application in sync with your current DB schema any divergence between your code and the DDL will be flagged by the Go compiler.

Code Generation
---------------

Install the `sqlc` command line tool:

	$ go get github.com/relops/sqlc

Make sure `sqlc` is on your PATH (usually $GOPATH/bin).

Then point `sqlc` at your sqlite DB file:

	$ sqlc -h
	Usage:
	  sqlc [OPTIONS]

	Application Options:
	  -f, --file=    The path to the sqlite file
	  -u, --url=     The DB URL
	  -o, --output=  The path to save the generated objects to
	  -p, --package= The package to put the generated objects into

	Help Options:
	  -h, --help     Show this help message

Now you can use the generated objects in your app.

Status
------

Experimental - this is work in progress. Basically I'm trying to port [JOOQ][] to Go, but I don't know yet whether it will work.
