`sqlc` is a composable, type safe and fluent API to generate nested and complex SQL queries.

Taking heavy inspiration from [JOOQ][], `sqlc` generates SQL queries for you:
	
```go	
var FOO sqlc.TableLike // (optionally) auto-generated by sqlc by introspecting your DDL

var db *db.DB // For integration with database/sql
var d Dialect // Either sqlite, mysql or postgres

row, err := Select(FOO.BAR).From(FOO).Where(FOO.BAZ.Eq("quux")).QueryRow(d, db)
```

If you don't want to use `database/sql`, you don't have to - ultimately `sqlc` is just a string building tool.

`String(Dialect)` is an API call to just produce the SQL string that you use in any way that you want to:

```go
// Renders `SELECT foo.bar FROM foo WHERE foo.baz = ?`
sql := Select(FOO.BAR).From(FOO).Where(FOO.BAZ.Eq("quux")).String(d)
```

Composing Queries
-----------------

You can compose query objects into reusebale and individually executable building blocks. For example, you can create a sub query that is in itself executable:

```go
subQuery := Select(
	CALL_RECORDS.REGION,
	CALL_RECORDS.DURATION.Min(),
	CALL_RECORDS.DURATION.Max(),
	CALL_RECORDS.DURATION.Avg()).
	From(CALL_RECORDS).
	GroupBy(CALL_RECORDS.REGION).
	OrderBy(CALL_RECORDS.REGION)

row, err := subQuery.QueryRow(d, db)
```

And then you re-use the subquery as part of a new query:

```go
row, err := SelectCount().From(subQuery).QueryRow(d, db)
```

Type Safety
-----------

`sqlc` provides type safe methods for INSERTs and UPDATEs:

```go
result, err := InsertInto(CALL_RECORDS).
	SetString(CALL_RECORDS.IMSI, "230023741299234").
	SetTime(CALL_RECORDS.TIMESTAMP, time.Now()).
	SetInt(CALL_RECORDS.DURATION, 10).
	SetString(CALL_RECORDS.REGION, "quux").
	SetString(CALL_RECORDS.CALLING_NUMBER, "76581231298").
	SetString(CALL_RECORDS.CALLED_NUMBER, "76754238764").
	Exec(d, db)
```

For example, the following invocation would not compile:

```go
...
SetTime(CALL_RECORDS.TIMESTAMP, "some string"). // Results in compile time error
...
```

If you use the `sqlc` code generator, you can keep your application in sync with your current DB schema any divergence between your code and the DDL will be flagged by the Go compiler.

Aliasing
--------

`sqlc` allows you to alias your projections easily:

```go
// Renders `SELECT foo.bar AS x, foo.baz AS y FROM foo`
Select(bar.As("x"), baz.As("y")).From(foo).String(d)
```

By default, columns will be qualified by the name of their parent table. You can override this by aliasing the table, in addition to aliasing just the fields:

```go
// Renders `SELECT f.bar AS x, f.baz AS y FROM foo AS f`
Select(bar.As("x"), baz.As("y")).From(foo.As("f")).String(d)
```

Functions
---------

Functions can be applied to any field and they can be nested to any depth:

```go
// Renders `SELECT LOWER(HEX(MD5(foo.bar))) FROM foo`
Select(bar.Md5().Hex().Lower()).From(foo).String(d)
```

Joins
-----

There is basic support for support for joins:

```go
// Renders `SELECT foo.bar, quux.col FROM foo JOIN quux 
//          ON (quux.id = foo.bar AND quux.col = foo.baz)`
Select(bar, col).From(foo).Join(quux).On(id.IsEq(bar), col.IsEq(baz)).String(d)
```

In addition to INNER JOINs, LEFT OUTER JOINs are also supported:

```go
// Renders `SELECT foo.bar FROM foo LEFT OUTER JOIN quux ON quux.id = foo.bar`
Select(bar).From(foo).LeftOuterJoin(quux).
On(id.IsEq(bar)).String(d)
```

An arbrirary number of joins can be constructed:

```go
// Renders `SELECT foo.bar FROM foo LEFT OUTER JOIN quux 
//          ON quux.id = foo.bar LEFT OUTER JOIN gorp ON gorp.porg = foo.bar`
Select(bar).From(foo).LeftOuterJoin(quux).
On(id.IsEq(bar)).LeftOuterJoin(gorp).On(porg.IsEq(bar)).String(d)
```


Code Generation
---------------

Install the `sqlc` command line tool:

	$ go get github.com/relops/sqlc

Make sure `sqlc` is on your PATH (usually $GOPATH/bin).

Then point `sqlc` at your sqlite DB file:

	$ sqlc -h
	Usage:
	  sqlc [OPTIONS]

	Application Options:
	  -f, --file=    The path to the sqlite file
      -u, --url=     The DB URL
      -o, --output=  The path to save the generated objects to
  	  -p, --package= The package to put the generated objects into
      -t, --type=    The type of the DB (mysql,postgres,sqlite)
      -s, --schema=  The target DB schema (required for MySQL and Postgres)

	Help Options:
	  -h, --help     Show this help message

Now you can use the generated objects in your app.

Pre-requisites
--------------

The integration tests depend on [go-bindata](https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata).

Status
------

Experimental - this is work in progress. Basically I'm trying to port [JOOQ][] to Go, but I don't know yet whether it will work.
